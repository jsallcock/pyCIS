White-light fringes
-------------------

In general a uniaxial crystal between aligned polarisers will not produce a white-light fringe pattern. This is because
the interferometer delay introduced is generally much larger than the coherence time. However, when the crystal's optic
axis is parallel to the optical axis of the system (i.e. the cut angle = 90 degrees) then the delay introduced in the
image centre is zero, increasing radially towards the image corners, producing a circular fringe pattern.

Another way to produce white-light fringes is using a Savart plate between aligned polarisers. This also produces zero
delay at the image centre, but now the delay is sheared in one direction, producing a linear fringe pattern.
