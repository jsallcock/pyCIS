# pycis

Analysis and modelling tools for the Coherence Imaging Spectroscopy (CIS) plasma diagnostic technique. The core Mueller matrix model makes it simple to model arbitrary interferometer layouts observing scenes with arbitrary spectral and polarisation properties. Perfect for all of your 2-D spectro-polarimetric plasma diagnostic needs. 

[Docs are a work in progress](https://jsallcock.github.io/pycis/), and not currently live. Codebase is just beginning to stabilise. See demo scripts for use examples or [contact me](https://twitter.com/JSAllcock) for a walkthrough.
