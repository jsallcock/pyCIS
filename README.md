Analysis and modelling tools for the Coherence Imaging Spectroscopy (CIS) plasma diagnostic technique. The core Mueller matrix model makes it simple to model arbitrary interferometer layouts observing scenes with arbitrary spectral and polarisation properties. Perfect for all of your 2-D spectro-polarimetric plasma diagnostic needs.
